# Destroy Framework Testing Log

**Last Updated**: October 20, 2025

This document tracks testing sessions for the destroy framework, documenting bugs found, fixes applied, and validation results.

---

## October 20, 2025 Testing Session

### Context
- **Objective**: Test `destroy-environment.sh` script in dev environment
- **Environment**: AWS Account 822529998967 (dev)
- **Script Version**: destroy-environment.sh (commit 4c3dac9)
- **Tester**: Platform team

### Test Execution

**Command Run**:
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=dev-deploy ./scripts/destroy/destroy-environment.sh dev --dry-run
```

### Critical Bug Discovered (P0)

**Issue**: Shell word splitting in `get_bucket_list()` function
- **Severity**: P0 (Critical)
- **Impact**: Script attempted to delete error messages as if they were bucket names
- **Root Cause**: Using `echo "${buckets[@]}"` caused shell word splitting when Terraform outputs contained errors or warnings

**Symptoms**:
```bash
[ACTION] Preparing bucket: Warning:
[ACTION] Preparing bucket: No
[ACTION] Preparing bucket: outputs
[ACTION] Preparing bucket: found
```

**Fix Applied** (Commit 18615c3):
```bash
# Before (BROKEN):
get_bucket_list() {
    # ...
    echo "${buckets[@]}"  # ❌ Word splitting!
}

# After (FIXED):
get_bucket_list() {
    # ...
    printf '%s\n' "${buckets[@]}"  # ✅ Safe iteration
}

# Updated loop to use while read:
while IFS= read -r bucket; do
    [[ -z "$bucket" ]] && continue
    # Process bucket safely
done <<< "$buckets"
```

### Enhancements Implemented (P1)

#### 1. Terraform State Validation (Commit 4c3dac9)
**Feature**: Pre-destroy validation to check if Terraform state exists and contains resources

**Implementation**:
```bash
validate_terraform_state() {
    local terraform_dir="$1"

    # Check if state file exists and has resources
    if ! tofu state list -chdir="$terraform_dir" &>/dev/null; then
        return 1
    fi

    local resource_count
    resource_count=$(tofu state list -chdir="$terraform_dir" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

    if [[ $resource_count -eq 0 ]]; then
        return 1
    fi

    return 0
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents unnecessary destroy operations when state is empty
- Provides clear feedback when infrastructure was never deployed
- Allows user to confirm continuation in edge cases

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**Improvements**:
- Added output validation using regex patterns to filter Terraform warnings
- Implemented bucket name format validation (3-63 chars, lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens)
- Added empty line filtering in bucket processing loop
- Improved error messages for missing state

**Code Example**:
```bash
# Filter out Terraform warnings from bucket names
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]] && [[ ! "$main_bucket" =~ ^(Warning:|Error:|╷|│|╵) ]] && [[ -n "$main_bucket" ]]; then
    buckets+=("$main_bucket")
fi

# Validate bucket name format
if [[ -n "$bucket_name" ]] && [[ "$bucket_name" =~ ^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{1,61}[a-z0-9]$ ]]; then
    buckets+=("$bucket_name")
fi
```

### Additional Recommendations from Testing

Based on the October 20 testing session, the following recommendations were identified (prioritized by impact):

#### Priority 2 (P2) - Should Implement
1. **CloudWatch Composite Alarm Handling** (1 hour)
   - **Issue**: Composite alarms may block metric alarm deletion
   - **Solution**: Detect and destroy composite alarms before metric alarms

2. **Multi-Region Dry-Run Improvements** (1 hour)
   - **Issue**: Dry-run only scans default region
   - **Solution**: Scan all US regions for comprehensive resource discovery

#### Priority 3 (P3) - Nice to Have
3. **State Refresh Before Destroy** (30 min)
   - **Issue**: May attempt to delete already-deleted resources
   - **Solution**: Add `tofu refresh` before destroy operations

4. **Progress Reporting** (1 hour)
   - **Issue**: Long-running operations appear to hang
   - **Solution**: Add progress indicators for S3 emptying operations

5. **Enhanced Logging** (30 min)
   - **Issue**: Difficult to troubleshoot failures
   - **Solution**: Add structured logging with timestamps and operation IDs

### Test Results

**Dry-Run Mode**:
- ✅ Successfully identified all resources to be destroyed
- ✅ No false positive bucket detection
- ✅ Clear output showing preserved vs destroyed resources
- ✅ Proper validation of Terraform state

**Force Mode** (Post-Fix):
- ✅ Bucket preparation completed successfully
- ✅ Versioning suspended on all buckets
- ✅ Logging disabled on all buckets
- ✅ All versions and delete markers removed
- ✅ Terraform destroy completed without errors
- ✅ Bootstrap resources correctly preserved

### Cross-Account Testing Status

**Current Limitation**: Testing performed in single account only (dev: 822529998967)

**Cross-Account Testing** (Not Yet Performed):
- ⏳ Staging account (927588814642) - Pending
- ⏳ Prod account (546274483801) - Pending
- ⏳ Cross-account role assumption - Not tested (requires management account access)

**Reason**: `destroy-environment.sh` focuses on workload destruction within a single account. Cross-account features are handled by `destroy-infrastructure.sh` which requires management account credentials.

### Documentation Updates

**Files Updated**:
1. ✅ `scripts/destroy/README.md` - Added destroy-environment.sh documentation
2. ✅ `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Updated Section 8 from 30% → 60% complete
3. ✅ `scripts/destroy/TESTING.md` - This file created

**Files Pending Update**:
1. ⏳ `scripts/destroy/destroy-environment.sh` - Header documentation
2. ⏳ `docs/quickstart.md` - Add destroy scenario
3. ⏳ `docs/deployment.md` - Reference destroy scripts
4. ⏳ `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Add destroy troubleshooting section
5. ⏳ `docs/destroy-runbook.md` - Create comprehensive runbook

### Lessons Learned

1. **Shell Safety**: Always use `printf '%s\n'` instead of `echo` for arrays to prevent word splitting
2. **Output Filtering**: Terraform outputs may contain warnings/errors that need filtering
3. **Validation First**: Check state exists before attempting operations
4. **User Experience**: Clear messages about what's preserved vs destroyed prevents confusion
5. **Idempotency**: Scripts should handle edge cases like missing state gracefully

### Next Testing Priorities

1. **Staging Environment Test** (30 min)
   - Deploy minimal infrastructure to staging
   - Test destroy-environment.sh in staging account
   - Verify cross-account IAM permissions work correctly

2. **Production Dry-Run** (15 min)
   - Run dry-run only in production
   - Validate resource detection
   - Confirm bootstrap resource preservation logic

3. **Full Infrastructure Destroy** (1 hour)
   - Test `destroy-infrastructure.sh` from management account
   - Validate cross-account destruction
   - Test with `--account-filter` for safety
