| **S3 Standard** | 1GB storage, 10K requests | $0.25 | Primary storage for static assets |
| **S3 CRR** | 1GB replication | $0.03 | Cross-region replication for DR |
| **CloudFront** | 100GB transfer, 1M requests | $8.50 | Global content delivery |
| **Route 53** | 1 hosted zone, 1M queries | $0.90 | DNS service with health checks |
| **AWS WAF** | 1 Web ACL, 1M requests | $6.00 | Web application firewall |
| **ACM** | 1 SSL certificate | $0.00 | Free SSL/TLS certificates |
| **CloudWatch** | 10 metrics, 1GB logs | $2.50 | Monitoring and logging |
| **AWS Config** | 100 items | $2.00 | Compliance monitoring |
| **Data Transfer** | 100GB outbound | $9.00 | Internet egress charges |
| **GitHub Actions** | 2000 minutes | $0.00 | Free tier sufficient |

**Total Monthly Cost: ~$29.18**

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **S3 Intelligent Tiering**: Automatic cost savings of 20-68% for infrequently accessed content
2. **CloudFront Caching**: 85%+ cache hit ratio reduces origin costs by 85%
3. **Regional Optimization**: Use CloudFront price classes to limit edge locations
4. **Reserved Capacity**: 75% savings for predictable CloudFront usage

### Annual Cost Projection

- **Year 1**: $350 (includes setup and testing)
- **Steady State**: $300-400/year depending on traffic growth
