## Workflow Safety Measures Implemented

**‚úÖ CRITICAL SAFETY**: All automatic workflow triggers have been disabled during migration to prevent:
- Deployments to decommissioned single-account infrastructure
- Build failures due to missing AWS resources
- Accidental modification of existing (empty) accounts

**Current Workflow Status:**
- ‚úÖ BUILD: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ‚úÖ TEST: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`) 
- ‚úÖ RUN: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ‚úÖ RELEASE: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ‚úÖ EMERGENCY: Already manual-only (no changes needed)

**Post-Migration Re-enablement**: Automatic triggers will be restored in Phase 6 with proper multi-account routing logic.

## Architecture Alignment Notes

This roadmap aligns with AWS Security Reference Architecture (SRA) and incorporates best practices from enterprise gold-standard patterns. The implementation is staged to deliver:

1. **Immediate Value (MVP)**: Secure, operational website within 4-6 weeks
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enterprise features added based on scale and requirements
3. **Cost Optimization**: Features scaled with actual needs, not theoretical requirements
4. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Security controls implemented based on threat model

For detailed gap analysis against enterprise standards, see comparison report with mhanyc/aws-ent-architecture.

2. **Implement Nested OU Architecture**: Migrate to team/app-based nested organizational units
3. **Enhance OPA Policies**: Add multi-account validation rules (organization, cross-account IAM, KMS)
4. **Consider MVP Simplification**: Evaluate temporary CloudFront removal for faster MVP deployment
5. **Create App-Specific Accounts**: Deploy dev/staging/prod accounts for static-site app
6. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement account-specific deployment routing
