# Static Site Infrastructure - MVP Pipeline Completion Plan

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: 🎯 MVP PIPELINE OPERATIONAL - COMPLETING REMAINING TASKS

## Current MVP Pipeline Status ✅ OPERATIONAL

### Core Pipeline Health Check (September 17, 2025)
```
🎯 BUILD → TEST → RUN Pipeline: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
├── BUILD Workflow: ✅ SUCCESS (1m37s) - All security scans passing
├── TEST Workflow: ✅ SUCCESS (39s) - OPA policy validation working
├── RUN Workflow: ✅ SUCCESS (11s) - Multi-account deployment working
├── Automatic Triggers: ✅ Working - TEST triggers RUN correctly
└── 12-Factor Compliance: ✅ COMPLETE - Variables externalized
```

### Workflow Test Results (Force Testing Complete)

- **Test Configuration**: Updated for new variable structure ✅

#### ✅ AWS Best Practice OIDC - COMPLETE
- **Central OIDC Provider**: Management account configured ✅
- **Environment Roles**: Dev/Staging/Prod roles deployed ✅
- **Cross-Account Auth**: GitHub Variables + OIDC working ✅
- **Security Controls**: Least-privilege, time-limited sessions ✅
- **Repository Trust**: Environment-specific trust conditions ✅

## MVP Completion Tasks

### 🔥 Critical Path - Complete MVP (P0)

#### 1. Fix EMERGENCY Workflow (Hours 1-2)
**Priority**: P2 - Emergency workflows secondary to core pipeline

**Issue**: EMERGENCY workflow uses old `terraform/` directory structure and hardcoded values.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update EMERGENCY workflow to use `terraform/environments/{env}/` structure
- [ ] Replace hard-coded account IDs with GitHub Variables
- [ ] Test emergency hotfix and rollback operations
- [ ] Validate staging and prod emergency operations

#### 2. Complete Multi-Account Testing (Hours 2-3)
**Priority**: P1 - Validate full multi-account deployment

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test staging environment deployment via RUN workflow
- [ ] Test production environment deployment (manual trigger only)
- [ ] Validate environment isolation (no cross-account access)
- [ ] Test rollback procedures for each environment

#### 3. Performance Optimization (Hours 3-4)
**Priority**: P2 - Optimize for production readiness

**Current Performance** vs **Targets**:
- BUILD: 1m37s (Target: <2min) ✅
- TEST: 39s (Target: <1min) ✅
- RUN: 11s (Target: <30s) ✅

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Parallel job optimization in BUILD workflow
- [ ] Cache optimization for Terraform operations
- [ ] Artifact caching between BUILD and TEST phases

### 🛡️ Security Hardening (P1)

#### Production Deployment Protection
**Status**: Basic protection implemented, needs enhancement

**Current**:
- ✅ Manual authorization required for production deployments
- ✅ Code owner authorization for production emergencies
- ✅ Environment-specific OIDC trust conditions

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement production deployment approval environments
- [ ] Add security review gates for infrastructure changes
- [ ] Implement automated security baseline validation

#### OPA Policy Enhancement
**Status**: Basic policies working, needs production hardening

**Current**:
- ✅ Foundation security policies (6 deny rules)
- ✅ Foundation compliance policies (5 warn rules)
- ✅ Environment-specific enforcement (prod blocks, dev warns)

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Add cost management policies
- [ ] Add resource naming and tagging enforcement policies
- [ ] Add network security policies for production

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability (P2)

#### Deployment Monitoring
**Current**: Basic workflow status reporting

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement deployment success/failure notifications
- [ ] Add cost tracking and budget alerts
- [ ] Create operational dashboards for deployment health
- [ ] Implement automated rollback triggers for failed deployments

#### Security Monitoring
**Current**: Security scan results in artifacts

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate security findings with security dashboard
- [ ] Implement automated security incident response
- [ ] Add compliance reporting for audit requirements

## Success Criteria - MVP Complete ✅
