## MVP Completion Tasks

### 🔥 Critical Path - Complete MVP (P0)

#### 1. Fix Infrastructure Deployment Conflicts (Hours 2-4)
**Priority**: P1 - Blocks both RUN and EMERGENCY workflows

**Issue**: Terraform module provider configuration conflicts prevent infrastructure deployment

**Root Causes**:
- Module `static_website` has local AWS provider configuration conflicting with root override
- Backend configuration warnings in module workload structure
- Both RUN and EMERGENCY workflows affected by same infrastructure issues

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze and resolve Terraform provider configuration conflicts in modules
- [ ] Update module structure to allow provider configuration overrides
- [ ] Test infrastructure deployment in dev environment first
- [ ] Update EMERGENCY workflow to use `terraform/environments/{env}/` structure
- [ ] Replace EMERGENCY workflow hard-coded account IDs with GitHub Variables
- [ ] Validate both RUN and EMERGENCY workflows deploy successfully

#### 2. Complete Multi-Account Testing (Hours 2-3)
**Priority**: P1 - Validate full multi-account deployment (depends on infrastructure fix)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test staging environment deployment via RUN workflow (after infrastructure fix)
- [ ] Test production environment deployment (manual trigger only)
- [ ] Validate environment isolation (no cross-account access)
- [ ] Test rollback procedures for each environment
- [ ] Verify enhanced URL display works with actual staging/prod deployments

#### 3. Performance Optimization (Hours 3-4)
**Priority**: P2 - Optimize for production readiness

**Current Performance** vs **Targets**:
- BUILD: 1m37s (Target: <2min) ✅
- TEST: 39s (Target: <1min) ✅
- RUN: 18-29s (Target: <30s) ✅ (increased due to infrastructure attempts)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Parallel job optimization in BUILD workflow
- [ ] Cache optimization for Terraform operations
- [ ] Artifact caching between BUILD and TEST phases

### 🛡️ Security Hardening (P1)

#### Production Deployment Protection
**Status**: Basic protection implemented, needs enhancement

**Current**:
- ✅ Manual authorization required for production deployments
- ✅ Code owner authorization for production emergencies
- ✅ Environment-specific OIDC trust conditions

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement production deployment approval environments

- [ ] Implement automated security baseline validation

#### OPA Policy Enhancement
**Status**: Basic policies working, needs production hardening

**Current**:

- ✅ Foundation compliance policies (5 warn rules)
- ✅ Environment-specific enforcement (prod blocks, dev warns)

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Add cost management policies
- [ ] Add resource naming and tagging enforcement policies
- [ ] Add network security policies for production

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability (P2)

#### Deployment Monitoring
**Current**: Basic workflow status reporting

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement deployment success/failure notifications
- [ ] Add cost tracking and budget alerts
- [ ] Create operational dashboards for deployment health
- [ ] Implement automated rollback triggers for failed deployments

#### Security Monitoring
**Current**: Security scan results in artifacts

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate security findings with security dashboard
- [ ] Implement automated security incident response

**🔄 IN PROGRESS - Remaining MVP Tasks**:
- Infrastructure deployment conflicts (blocks RUN and EMERGENCY)
- Complete multi-account testing (staging/prod)
- Production security hardening

**⚠️ CURRENT BLOCKER**: Terraform module provider configuration conflicts prevent actual infrastructure deployment in both RUN and EMERGENCY workflows.

**🎯 NEXT PRIORITY**: Fix infrastructure deployment conflicts affecting both RUN and EMERGENCY workflows, then complete multi-account deployment testing.

**Timeline**: Infrastructure fix + MVP completion within 7 days, production-ready within 12 days.

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM - Core pipeline operational for workflow automation, but infrastructure deployment blocked by module configuration conflicts.
