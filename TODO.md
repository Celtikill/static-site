## SRA-Aligned Multi-Account Architecture Plan

### Architecture Overview
Following AWS Security Reference Architecture (SRA) patterns with complete environment isolation:

```
Organization (o-0hh51yjgxw)
├── Management Account (223938610551)
├── Security OU
│   ├── Security Tooling Account (centralized security services)
│   └── Log Archive Account (centralized audit logs)

## Workflow Safety Measures Implemented

**✅ CRITICAL SAFETY**: All automatic workflow triggers have been disabled during migration to prevent:
- Deployments to decommissioned single-account infrastructure
- Build failures due to missing AWS resources
- Accidental modification of existing (empty) accounts

**Current Workflow Status:**
- ✅ BUILD: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ TEST: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`) 
- ✅ RUN: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ RELEASE: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ EMERGENCY: Already manual-only (no changes needed)

**Post-Migration Re-enablement**: Automatic triggers will be restored in Phase 6 with proper multi-account routing logic.

- Account-level IAM boundaries
- Centralized security monitoring and compliance
- Organization-wide audit trail

**Operational Benefits:**
- Clear cost attribution per environment
- Environment-specific access controls
- Simplified resource management
- Standardized security baselines

**Compliance Benefits:**

- Comprehensive audit capabilities

---

## Migration Strategy

**Clean Slate Approach:** ✅ Complete

- Eliminates configuration drift and legacy issues
- Enables proper SRA implementation from ground up

**Incremental Deployment:**
- Management Account → Security Accounts → Workload Accounts
- Validate each phase before proceeding
- Maintain rollback capability at each step

**Zero-Downtime Migration:**
- Current website remains operational during migration
- New architecture deployed in parallel
- DNS cutover only after full validation

## Architecture Alignment Notes

This roadmap aligns with AWS Security Reference Architecture (SRA) and incorporates best practices from enterprise gold-standard patterns. The implementation is staged to deliver:

1. **Immediate Value (MVP)**: Secure, operational website within 4-6 weeks
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enterprise features added based on scale and requirements
3. **Cost Optimization**: Features scaled with actual needs, not theoretical requirements
4. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Security controls implemented based on threat model
