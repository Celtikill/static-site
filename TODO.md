# Implementation Roadmap

## Active Development (In Progress)

**Phase 3: Version Management** - HIGH Priority âš¡
**Phase 5: Documentation** - HIGH Priority âš¡

### Documentation Tasks (Recently Completed)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with accurate job counts and remove archived workflow references
- [x] Create TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common CI/CD issues and solutions
- [x] Enhance README.md with performance baselines and clearer environment routing
- [x] Update docs/architecture/cicd.md with missing workflow details
- [x] Create docs/workflows/secrets-and-variables.md for secrets documentation

### Documentation Tasks (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Add workflow execution time benchmarks to all workflow documentation
- [ ] Create visual workflow decision tree diagram
- [ ] Document rollback procedures in detail
- [ ] Add cost estimation guidelines for each environment
- [ ] Create developer onboarding guide with setup checklist

### Testing Strategy Implementation (Long-term)
- [ ] **Step 3: Separate Integration Tests** - Create dedicated integration test suite for AWS authentication and real deployment testing
  - Move AWS role assumption tests to `test/integration/test-aws-authentication.sh`
  - Create full deployment flow tests in `test/integration/test-deployment-flow.sh`
  - Add cross-environment testing in `test/integration/test-cross-environment.sh`
  - Configure integration tests to run only when AWS credentials are available
  - Add integration test workflow that runs on-demand or on releases

- [ ] **Step 4: Security Policy Validation** - Implement OPA (Open Policy Agent) security compliance testing
  - Create OPA policies for infrastructure security validation
  - Add policy validation tests using `opa eval` with mock Terraform plans
  - Implement security compliance checking for OWASP Top 10, CIS benchmarks
  - Add automated security policy testing in TEST workflow
  - Create security policy documentation and violation reporting

### Testing Architecture Completed
- [x] **Step 1: Static Analysis** - Implemented configuration validation without AWS dependencies
  - Created `test-static-analysis.sh` with ARN format validation, role naming, region validation
  - Added environment variable structure testing and GitHub Actions detection
  - Implemented branch pattern detection and configuration consistency checks

- [x] **Step 2: Terraform Plan Validation** - Added infrastructure testing without authentication
  - Created `test-terraform-plan.sh` with plan generation testing for all environments
  - Added resource validation, module dependency checking, and variable definition testing
  - Implemented environment-specific configuration validation
  - Added contract testing with `test-contract.sh` for script interface validation

## Infrastructure Enhancements (Deferred)

| Phase | Priority | Effort | Impact | Target | Key Benefits |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Configuration** | Medium | High | High | Q2 2025 | Zero secrets in code, auto-rotation, audit trails |
| **Policy Framework** | Medium | Medium | High | Q2 2025 | 100% coverage, zero violations, automated compliance |
| **CI/CD Enhancement** | Low | High | Medium | Q3 2025 | Advanced security scanning, deployment protection |
| **Cost Optimization** | Low | Medium | Medium | Q3 2025 | 30%+ cost reduction, anomaly detection, real-time monitoring |
| **Multi-Account** | Low | Very High | Very High | Q4 2025 | Complete isolation, 100% cost attribution, enterprise security |

### Configuration Externalization (Q2 2025)
- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager migration with auto-rotation
- [ ] Parameter Store hierarchy (/static-site/{env}/)
- [ ] Dynamic CI/CD configuration retrieval

### Policy Framework (Q2 2025)
- [ ] Hierarchical policy structure (security/, compliance/, data_governance/)
- [ ] Comprehensive security policies with testing framework
- [ ] OPA policy unit tests with scenarios

### CI/CD Enhancement (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Security scanning matrix (Checkov, Trivy, additional tools)
- [ ] Environment-specific deployment protection and approval workflows
- [ ] Infrastructure cost estimation with threshold alerts

### Cost Optimization (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Infrastructure cost baseline documentation
- [ ] Right-sizing, reserved capacity optimization
- [ ] Real-time cost dashboard with anomaly detection
- [ ] **PENDING**: Automated CI/CD cost monitoring and reporting

### Multi-Account Migration (Q4 2025)
**AWS Organizations Setup:**
- [ ] Account hierarchy (Dev, Staging, Prod, Security accounts)
- [ ] OU structure with environment-specific policies

**Infrastructure Migration:**
- [ ] Terraform refactoring for multi-account deployment
- [ ] Cross-account IAM and OIDC configuration
- [ ] Account-specific deployment workflows

**Gradual Migration:**
- [ ] Development account (lowest risk validation)
- [ ] Staging account (production-like restrictions)
- [ ] Production account (zero-downtime, maximum security)

**Benefits:** Hard isolation boundaries, clear cost attribution, simplified IAM, enhanced security posture
