## Infrastructure Enhancements (Deferred)

| Phase | Priority | Effort | Impact | Target | Key Benefits |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Configuration** | Medium | High | High | Q2 2025 | Zero secrets in code, auto-rotation, audit trails |
| **Policy Framework** | Medium | Medium | High | Q2 2025 | 100% coverage, zero violations, automated compliance |
| **CI/CD Enhancement** | Low | High | Medium | Q3 2025 | Advanced security scanning, deployment protection |
| **Cost Optimization** | Low | Medium | Medium | Q3 2025 | 30%+ cost reduction, anomaly detection, real-time monitoring |
| **Multi-Account** | Low | Very High | Very High | Q4 2025 | Complete isolation, 100% cost attribution, enterprise security |

### Configuration Externalization (Q2 2025)
- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager migration with auto-rotation
- [ ] Parameter Store hierarchy (/static-site/{env}/)
- [ ] Dynamic CI/CD configuration retrieval

### Policy Framework (Q2 2025)
- [ ] Hierarchical policy structure (security/, compliance/, data_governance/)
- [ ] Comprehensive security policies with testing framework
- [ ] OPA policy unit tests with scenarios

### CI/CD Enhancement (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Security scanning matrix (Checkov, Trivy, additional tools)
- [ ] Environment-specific deployment protection and approval workflows
- [ ] Infrastructure cost estimation with threshold alerts

### Cost Optimization (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Infrastructure cost baseline documentation
- [ ] Right-sizing, reserved capacity optimization
- [ ] Real-time cost dashboard with anomaly detection
- [ ] **PENDING**: Automated CI/CD cost monitoring and reporting

### Multi-Account Migration (Q4 2025)
**AWS Organizations Setup:**
- [ ] Account hierarchy (Dev, Staging, Prod, Security accounts)
- [ ] OU structure with environment-specific policies

**Infrastructure Migration:**
- [ ] Terraform refactoring for multi-account deployment
- [ ] Cross-account IAM and OIDC configuration
- [ ] Account-specific deployment workflows

**Gradual Migration:**
- [ ] Development account (lowest risk validation)
- [ ] Staging account (production-like restrictions)
- [ ] Production account (zero-downtime, maximum security)

**Benefits:** Hard isolation boundaries, clear cost attribution, simplified IAM, enhanced security posture
