## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 0: Current State Documentation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
*Status: Done on 2025-09-10*

- ‚úÖ Documented working single-account configuration
- ‚úÖ Verified all IAM roles and permissions
- ‚úÖ Confirmed GitHub Actions workflows operational
- ‚úÖ Created CURRENT-STATE.md with full details
- ‚úÖ Updated INFRASTRUCTURE-STATE.md

### **Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure with MVP Security** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
*Duration: 6-8 hours | Risk: Low*

#### **Step 1.1: Deploy Organization Management with Security Foundation**
```bash
# Update terraform.tfvars with MVP security settings
# terraform/foundations/org-management/terraform.tfvars
enable_cloudtrail = true          # MVP: Always enabled
enable_guardduty = false         # MVP: Feature flagged, default off
enable_config = false            # MVP: Feature flagged, default off
enable_security_hub = false      # MVP: Feature flagged, default off

# Deploy via GitHub Actions (preferred)
gh workflow run run.yml \
  --field environment=management \
  --field deploy_infrastructure=true \
  --field terraform_directory=foundations/org-management
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- AWS Organizations with Security/Workloads/Sandbox OUs
- Organization-wide CloudTrail (MVP logging requirement)
- Service Control Policies for security guardrails
- Management account OIDC provider for GitHub Actions
- KMS keys for encryption at rest (SRA requirement)

#### **Step 1.2: Deploy Account Factory with Security OU Setup**
```bash
# Update domain in terraform.tfvars first, then deploy
gh workflow run run.yml \
  --field environment=management \
  --field deploy_infrastructure=true \
  --field terraform_directory=foundations/account-factory

# Monitor deployment
gh run list --limit 3
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **Security OU**: Security-Tooling Account (basic setup), Log-Archive Account
- **Workloads OU**: Development Account, Staging Account, Production Account
- Cross-account roles configured for MVP access patterns
- SSM parameters with account IDs for reference
- Basic security tooling preparation (feature flagged)

---

### **Phase 2: MVP Security Service Feature Flags** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
*Duration: 4-6 hours | Risk: Low*

#### **Step 2.1: Create Security Feature Flag Configuration**

Create new file `terraform/foundations/security-services/variables.tf`:

```hcl
# MVP Security Services Feature Flags
variable "enable_guardduty" {
  description = "Enable GuardDuty threat detection"
  type        = bool
  default     = false  # MVP: Start with basic logging only
}

variable "enable_security_hub" {
  description = "Enable Security Hub compliance monitoring"
  type        = bool
  default     = false  # MVP: Enable after initial deployment
}

variable "enable_config" {
  description = "Enable AWS Config for resource tracking"
  type        = bool
  default     = false  # MVP: Enable for production only
}

variable "enable_access_analyzer" {
  description = "Enable IAM Access Analyzer"
  type        = bool
  default     = true   # MVP: Low cost, high value
}
```

#### **Step 2.2: Deploy Basic Security Tooling (Feature Flagged)**
```bash
# Start with minimal services (CloudTrail + Access Analyzer only)
gh workflow run run.yml \
  --field environment=security \
  --field deploy_infrastructure=true \
  --field terraform_directory=foundations/security-services
```

---

### **Phase 3: Workload Account Migration** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
*Duration: 8-10 hours | Risk: Medium*

#### **Step 3.1: Migrate Development Environment**
```bash
# First, backup current state
aws s3 sync s3://static-site-terraform-state-us-east-1/ ./state-backup/

# Update backend configuration for new account
# terraform/workloads/static-site/backend-dev.hcl

# Deploy to development account
gh workflow run run.yml \
  --field environment=dev \
  --field deploy_infrastructure=true \
  --field account_id=<DEV_ACCOUNT_ID>
```

#### **Step 3.2: Deploy Staging Environment**
```bash
gh workflow run run.yml \
  --field environment=staging \
  --field deploy_infrastructure=true \
  --field account_id=<STAGING_ACCOUNT_ID>
```

#### **Step 3.3: Deploy Production Environment**
```bash
# Requires approval workflow
gh workflow run release.yml \
  --field version=v1.0.0 \
  --field environment=prod
```

---

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
*Duration: 4-6 hours | Risk: Low*

#### **Step 4.1: Cross-Account Access Testing**
```bash
# Test role assumption from GitHub Actions
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/github-actions-deployment \
  --role-session-name test-session
```

#### **Step 4.2: Security Service Validation**
- Verify CloudTrail logs in Log Archive account
- Test GuardDuty findings (if enabled)
- Review Security Hub compliance (if enabled)
- Validate IAM Access Analyzer findings

---

### **Phase 5: Cutover & Cleanup** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
*Duration: 2-3 hours | Risk: Low*

1. Update DNS records to point to new infrastructure
2. Migrate any remaining resources
3. Decommission single-account resources
4. Update documentation

---

## Cost Optimization for MVP

### Current Costs (Single Account)
- **Monthly**: ~$6.51
- **Annual Projection**: ~$78.12

### Projected Multi-Account Costs
- **Management Account**: ~$5/month (Organizations, CloudTrail)
- **Security Accounts**: ~$10/month (Basic logging and monitoring)
- **Per Workload Account**: ~$7-15/month (depending on traffic)
- **Total Estimated**: ~$40-50/month for full multi-account setup

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering** for log storage
2. **Enable only essential security services** initially
3. **Use lifecycle policies** for log retention
4. **Implement auto-shutdown** for development resources
5. **Right-size resources** based on actual usage

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
1. All infrastructure as code in Git
2. State files backed up before migration
3. Gradual migration (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod)
4. Feature flags for security services
5. Parallel running during transition

### Known Challenges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cross-account S3 replication requires additional IAM setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CloudFront distributions may need recreation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DNS cutover timing for production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Secret rotation across accounts

---
