# Implementation Roadmap

## Active Development (In Progress)

**Multi-Account Architecture Migration** - CRITICAL Priority ⚡

### Current Status: Phase 3 Execution
**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 0: Clean Slate Preparation - All existing resources decommissioned
- ✅ Phase 1: AWS Organizations Foundation - Organization o-0hh51yjgxw created, Management Account 223938610551
- ✅ Phase 2: SRA-Aligned Terraform Module Development - All security baseline modules created and validated

**In Progress:**
- ✅ Phase 3: Management Account Infrastructure Configuration - **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Phase 4: Security OU Account Deployment
- [ ] Phase 5: Workload OU Account Deployment  
- [ ] Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline Migration
- [ ] Phase 7: Website Content Migration

## SRA-Aligned Multi-Account Architecture Plan

### Architecture Overview
Following AWS Security Reference Architecture (SRA) patterns with complete environment isolation:

```
Organization (o-0hh51yjgxw)
├── Management Account (223938610551)
├── Security OU
│   ├── Security Tooling Account (centralized security services)
│   └── Log Archive Account (centralized audit logs)
├── Infrastructure OU (future expansion)
└── Workloads OU
    ├── Development Account
    ├── Staging Account
    └── Production Account
```

### Phase 3: Management Account Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Disable automatic workflow triggers to prevent deployments to decommissioned infrastructure
- [x] Create comprehensive Terraform configuration in `terraform/management-account/`
- [x] Configure AWS Organizations module integration (OU structure, SCPs)
- [x] Configure Account Factory for Security OU accounts (Security Tooling + Log Archive)
- [x] Set up cross-account Terraform deployment roles and state buckets
- [x] Configure centralized state management with S3 backend
- [x] Create deployment documentation and validation guides
- [x] **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**: Configuration validated, awaiting `tofu apply`

### Phase 4: Security OU Account Deployment
- [ ] Deploy security baselines to Security Tooling Account:
  - GuardDuty (organization-wide threat detection)
  - Security Hub (centralized findings aggregation)
  - Config (compliance monitoring)
  - CloudTrail (organization trail)
- [ ] Configure Log Archive Account for centralized logging
- [ ] Establish cross-account log delivery

### Phase 5: Workload OU Account Deployment
- [ ] Create Development, Staging, Production accounts
- [ ] Deploy security baselines to each workload account
- [ ] Configure account-specific IAM and OIDC roles
- [ ] Set up cross-account access patterns

### Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline Migration
- [ ] **Workflow Updates Required:**
  - [ ] Update BUILD workflow: Add multi-account AWS provider configuration
  - [ ] Update TEST workflow: Configure cross-account validation
  - [ ] Update RUN workflow: Implement account-specific deployment logic
  - [ ] Update RELEASE workflow: Add multi-account release management
  - [ ] Re-enable automatic triggers with proper account routing
- [ ] Configure environment-specific deployment targeting
- [ ] Implement cross-account OIDC authentication  
- [ ] Update security scanning for multi-account context
- [ ] **GitHub Variables Updates:**
  - [ ] Add account-specific AWS role ARNs
  - [ ] Configure account ID mappings for each environment
  - [ ] Update Terraform backend configurations per account

### Phase 7: Website Content Migration
- [ ] Deploy static website infrastructure to each workload account
- [ ] Configure CloudFront and WAF per environment
- [ ] Test full deployment pipeline
- [ ] Validate monitoring and alerting

## Workflow Safety Measures Implemented

**✅ CRITICAL SAFETY**: All automatic workflow triggers have been disabled during migration to prevent:
- Deployments to decommissioned single-account infrastructure
- Build failures due to missing AWS resources
- Accidental modification of existing (empty) accounts

**Current Workflow Status:**
- ✅ BUILD: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ TEST: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`) 
- ✅ RUN: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ RELEASE: Manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- ✅ EMERGENCY: Already manual-only (no changes needed)

**Post-Migration Re-enablement**: Automatic triggers will be restored in Phase 6 with proper multi-account routing logic.

## Key Benefits of Multi-Account Architecture

**Security Benefits:**
- Complete environment isolation (blast radius containment)
- Account-level IAM boundaries
- Centralized security monitoring and compliance
- Organization-wide audit trail

**Operational Benefits:**
- Clear cost attribution per environment
- Environment-specific access controls
- Simplified resource management
- Standardized security baselines

**Compliance Benefits:**
- SRA-aligned architecture patterns
- AWS Well-Architected Framework compliance
- Centralized governance and policy enforcement
- Comprehensive audit capabilities

---

## Migration Strategy

**Clean Slate Approach:** ✅ Complete
- All existing resources decommissioned for fresh start
- Eliminates configuration drift and legacy issues
- Enables proper SRA implementation from ground up

**Incremental Deployment:**
- Management Account → Security Accounts → Workload Accounts
- Validate each phase before proceeding
- Maintain rollback capability at each step

**Zero-Downtime Migration:**
- Current website remains operational during migration
- New architecture deployed in parallel
- DNS cutover only after full validation

## Technical Implementation Notes

### 12-Factor App Integration
- **Config:** Environment-specific variables externalized to account level
- **Backing Services:** Security services as attached resources
- **Build/Release/Run:** Consistent deployment across all accounts
- **Stateless Processes:** Self-contained modules with minimal dependencies

### SRA Compliance
- Service Control Policies prevent root user access
- Mandatory encryption for all storage services
- Public access prevention across all accounts
- Centralized security tooling in dedicated account

### AWS Well-Architected Framework
- **Security:** Multi-layered defense, least privilege access
- **Reliability:** Cross-AZ deployment, automated recovery
- **Performance:** CloudFront global distribution
- **Cost:** Resource optimization, detailed cost attribution
- **Operational Excellence:** Infrastructure as Code, monitoring
- **Sustainability:** Right-sizing, efficient resource usage
