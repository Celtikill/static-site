# Static Site Infrastructure - Next Steps

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: âœ… WORKFLOWS OPERATIONAL - Ready for Multi-Account Deployment

## Current State

```
âœ… COMPLETED: Streamlined Workflow Architecture
â”œâ”€â”€ BUILD: Security scanning, artifact creation (21s)
â”œâ”€â”€ TEST: Policy validation, backend overrides working
â”œâ”€â”€ RUN: Environment coordination operational
â””â”€â”€ Deploy-Composite: Reusable workflow validated

AWS Organization: o-0hh51yjgxw
â”œâ”€â”€ Management (223938610551): OIDC provider âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ Dev (822529998967): Deployed & operational âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ Staging (927588814642): Ready for deployment
â””â”€â”€ Prod (224071442216): Ready for deployment
```

## Next Priority: Multi-Account Deployment

### Phase 1: AWS Credential Configuration
```bash
# Configure GitHub Secrets for cross-account deployment
AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_STAGING=arn:aws:iam::927588814642:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
AWS_ASSUME_ROLE_PROD=arn:aws:iam::224071442216:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole

# Test deployment to staging
gh workflow run run.yml --field environment=staging --field deploy_infrastructure=true

# Test deployment to production
gh workflow run run.yml --field environment=prod --field deploy_infrastructure=true
```

### Phase 2: PR-Based Staging Flow
- Create PR deployment workflow for automatic staging
- Generate RC tags for pull requests
- Post deployment URLs as PR comments

### Phase 3: Production Release Optimization
- Simplify release workflow for main branch only
- Add staging verification requirements
- Implement rollback procedures

## Completed Achievements âœ…

**Workflow Architecture Fixes:**
- Backend override solution for TEST workflows
- YAML syntax fixes for deploy-composite.yml  
- OpenTofu dependency setup across all jobs
- Format cleanup and validation warnings resolved

**Operational Validation:**
- BUILD workflow: 21s runtime, security scanning working
- TEST workflow: Backend initialization successful, reaches credential validation
- RUN workflow: Environment coordination functional
- Deploy-composite: Reusable workflow pattern operational

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Test operational workflows
gh workflow run build.yml --field force_build=true --field environment=dev
gh workflow run test.yml --field skip_build_check=true --field environment=dev
gh workflow run run.yml --field environment=dev --field deploy_infrastructure=true

# Multi-account deployment (requires credential configuration)
gh workflow run run.yml --field environment=staging --field deploy_infrastructure=true
gh workflow run run.yml --field environment=prod --field deploy_infrastructure=true

# Validation
tofu validate && tofu fmt -check
yamllint -d relaxed .github/workflows/*.yml
```

## Next Action

ðŸŽ¯ **Configure AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets to enable multi-account deployment execution**

The core workflow architecture is complete and operational. All infrastructure is ready for deployment with proper credential configuration.
