# Trivy Ignore File - Documented Security Exceptions

# This file contains security findings that are intentionally accepted

# Each exception must be documented with clear rationale.

# ========================================================================
# S3 Replication Wildcard Exceptions
# ========================================================================
# 
# AVD-AWS-0057: IAM policy should avoid use of wildcards
# 
# EXCEPTION RATIONALE:
# - S3 Cross-Region Replication requires wildcard permissions on bucket objects
# - AWS Service requirement for replication functionality
# - Wildcards are scoped to specific S3 buckets only (not global wildcards)
# - Risk is mitigated by:
#   * Replication role can only be assumed by S3 service
#   * Actions are limited to replication-specific operations
#   * Resources are constrained to known bucket ARNs
# 
# REFERENCE: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-iam-prerequisites.html
# 
# Files affected:
# - modules/s3/main.tf (S3 replication policy)
# 
AVD-AWS-0057

# S3 Access Logs Bucket Logging Exception
# ========================================================================
# 
# AVD-AWS-0089: S3 Bucket Logging
# 
# EXCEPTION RATIONALE:
# - Access logs bucket is the final destination for S3 logging
# - Adding logging to the logs bucket creates recursive complexity
# - CloudTrail provides comprehensive S3 API audit trails 
# - Risk is low: access logs bucket contains only log files, not sensitive application data
# - Industry standard practice: log aggregation buckets typically don't log themselves
# 
# ALTERNATIVE CONTROLS:
# - CloudTrail logs all S3 API operations including access to log buckets
# - VPC Flow Logs capture network-level access patterns
# - AWS Config monitors bucket configuration changes
# 
# Files affected:
# - modules/s3/main.tf (access_logs bucket)
# 
AVD-AWS-0089

# ========================================================================
# CloudFront Logging Dynamic Configuration Exception
# ========================================================================
# 
# AVD-AWS-0010: CloudFront distribution should have Access Logging configured
# 
# EXCEPTION RATIONALE:
# - CloudFront logging IS configured via dynamic configuration block
# - Trivy cannot evaluate dynamic blocks during static analysis
# - Logging is enabled when var.enable_access_logging = true
# - Logs are written to dedicated S3 access logs bucket
# - Configuration includes appropriate logging prefix for organization
# 
# ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:
# - Dynamic "logging_config" block in modules/cloudfront/main.tf
# - Conditionally enabled based on var.enable_access_logging
# - Logs stored in separate S3 bucket for security isolation
# - Prefix-based log organization for analysis
# 
# Files affected:
# - modules/cloudfront/main.tf (dynamic logging_config block)
# 
AVD-AWS-0010
