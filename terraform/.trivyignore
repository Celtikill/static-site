# S3 Replication Wildcard Exceptions
# ========================================================================
# 
# AVD-AWS-0057: IAM policy should avoid use of wildcards
# 
# EXCEPTION RATIONALE:
# - S3 Cross-Region Replication requires wildcard permissions on bucket objects
# - AWS Service requirement for replication functionality
# - Wildcards are scoped to specific S3 buckets only (not global wildcards)
# - Risk is mitigated by:
#   * Replication role can only be assumed by S3 service
#   * Actions are limited to replication-specific operations
#   * Resources are constrained to known bucket ARNs
# 
# REFERENCE: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-iam-prerequisites.html
