# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our AWS static website infrastructure seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@YOUR-DOMAIN.com** (replace with your actual security contact)

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Security Architecture

Our infrastructure implements multiple layers of security:

#### Infrastructure Security

    accTitle: Layered Infrastructure Security Architecture
    accDescr: Defense-in-depth security architecture implementing multiple protection layers for AWS infrastructure. Authentication layer uses GitHub OIDC eliminating stored credentials and providing temporary access tokens with automatic expiration reducing credential exposure risk. The Central Role in Management Account orchestrates cross-account access enabling deployments while maintaining account boundaries. Environment roles implement least privilege access with permissions scoped to specific resources and operations required for deployment preventing privilege escalation. Multi-account isolation provides blast radius containment where compromise of one environment cannot affect others maintaining security boundaries at the AWS account level. KMS encryption protects data at rest using customer-managed keys with envelope encryption ensuring data confidentiality even if storage is compromised. WAF protection provides application-layer security implementing OWASP Top 10 defenses including SQL injection prevention, cross-site scripting blocking, and rate limiting for DDoS protection. CloudWatch monitoring enables real-time visibility with comprehensive logging, metrics collection, automated alerting, and security event correlation supporting rapid incident detection and response. This layered approach ensures multiple independent security controls protect infrastructure with no single point of failure implementing defense-in-depth security principles.

#### Security Controls

**Authentication & Authorization**
- ‚úÖ **OIDC Authentication**: No stored AWS credentials in GitHub
- ‚úÖ **3-Tier Role Model**: Bootstrap ‚Üí Central ‚Üí Environment roles ([detailed architecture](docs/permissions-architecture.md))
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Account Isolation**: Separate AWS accounts per environment
- ‚úÖ **Least Privilege Access**: Environment-specific IAM policies

**Data Protection**
- ‚úÖ **Encryption at Rest**: KMS encryption for all S3 data
- ‚úÖ **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- ‚úÖ **Access Control**: Origin Access Control (OAC) prevents direct S3 access
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Region Replication**: Encrypted replication to us-west-2

**Network Security**
- ‚úÖ **WAF Protection**: OWASP Top 10 protection and rate limiting
- ‚úÖ **CloudFront Security**: Security headers and origin protection
- ‚úÖ **VPC Isolation**: Infrastructure deployed in isolated network segments

**Monitoring & Compliance**
- ‚úÖ **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting
- ‚úÖ **Security Scanning**: Automated Checkov and Trivy scans
- ‚úÖ **Policy Validation**: OPA/Rego policies with 100% compliance
- ‚úÖ **Budget Controls**: Cost monitoring and automated alerts

### Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes automated security scanning:

#### Static Analysis (BUILD Phase)
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure security scanning
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability and misconfiguration detection
- **Enforcement**: Blocks deployment on HIGH/CRITICAL findings

#### Policy Validation (TEST Phase)
- **OPA Policies**: 6 security deny rules + 5 compliance warn rules
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Detailed violation tables and debug output
- **Environment-Specific**: STRICT enforcement for production

#### Scan Results

graph LR
    accTitle: Security Scanning Decision Flow with Remediation Loop
    accDescr: Automated security scanning workflow implementing fail-fast security gates with remediation feedback loop. Security scanning executes during BUILD phase using Checkov for infrastructure-as-code security validation checking 50+ built-in policies covering AWS security best practices, CIS benchmarks, HIPAA compliance, and organizational standards, combined with Trivy for vulnerability detection scanning infrastructure configurations and dependencies for known CVEs and security misconfigurations. Risk assessment evaluates scan results classifying findings by severity with CRITICAL issues requiring immediate remediation representing exploitable vulnerabilities or severe misconfigurations, HIGH issues indicating significant security risks requiring remediation before deployment, MEDIUM issues flagged as warnings for review and remediation in backlog, and LOW issues logged for awareness without blocking deployment. Critical or High findings immediately trigger deployment blocking through the security gate preventing vulnerable infrastructure from reaching any environment implementing fail-fast security principles. Security approval for deployments without critical or high findings allows progression to deployment phases ensuring only secure infrastructure configurations advance through the pipeline. Blocked deployments require issue remediation fixing security violations through code changes, configuration updates, or architectural improvements creating secure alternatives. After remediation, code returns to security scanning for validation ensuring fixes resolved vulnerabilities without introducing new issues. This continuous feedback loop prevents security debt accumulation while maintaining deployment velocity by catching vulnerabilities early where remediation costs are lowest and blast radius is contained to development environments.

### Security Features by Environment

| Feature | Module Default | Development (example) | Staging (example) | Production (example) |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| OIDC Authentication | ‚úÖ Always | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| KMS Encryption | ‚úÖ Always | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| WAF Protection | ‚ùå Disabled¬π | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| CloudFront CDN | ‚ùå Disabled¬≤ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Cross-Region Replication | ‚úÖ Enabled¬≥ | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Enhanced Monitoring | ‚úÖ Always | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Policy Enforcement | - | INFORMATIONAL | WARNING | STRICT |

**Feature Flag Configuration:**
1. **WAF Protection**: Disabled by default (`enable_waf = false`). ~$5-10/month when enabled. WAF requires CloudFront for S3 static websites.
2. **CloudFront CDN**: Disabled by default (`enable_cloudfront = false`). ~$15-25/month when enabled. Uses direct S3 website hosting when disabled.
3. **Cross-Region Replication**: Enabled by default (`enable_cross_region_replication = true`). Adds ~2x storage costs and bandwidth charges.

> **Note**: The environment examples shown represent recommended patterns. Actual environment configurations (`terraform/environments/*/main.tf`) currently use module defaults. These features are controlled by feature flags in the OpenTofu/Terraform configuration. See [Feature Flags Documentation](docs/feature-flags.md) for detailed cost analysis and configuration options.

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

**Infrastructure Changes**
- Always run `tofu validate` and `tofu fmt -check` before committing
- Test security changes in development environment first
