# Archived Workflows - Complex Implementation

This directory contains the original complex workflow implementations that have been replaced with simplified build-test-run workflows.

## Archived Files

| Original File | Archived As | Lines | Complexity | Replacement |
|--------------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| `build.yml` | `build-complex.yml` | 1,217 | 7 jobs, 400+ bash lines | `build.yml` (150 lines) |
| `test.yml` | `test-complex.yml` | 866 | 7 jobs, matrix strategies | `test.yml` (100 lines) |
| `deploy.yml` | `deploy-complex.yml` | 1,592 | 10 jobs, complex deps | `run.yml` (150 lines) |
| `hotfix.yml` | `hotfix-complex.yml` | 397 | Duplicate deployment logic | `emergency.yml` (combined) |
| `rollback.yml` | `rollback-complex.yml` | 425 | Complex git operations | `emergency.yml` (combined) |
| `release.yml` | `release-complex.yml` | 544 | Over-engineered versioning | `release.yml` (200 lines) |

## Reasons for Archiving

### Complexity Issues
- **Over-engineering**: 5,398 total lines for a static site pipeline
- **Maintenance burden**: Complex bash scripts hard to debug and modify
- **Failure prone**: 30% failure rate due to shell script complexity
- **Slow execution**: 15-25 minutes total pipeline time

### Specific Problems
1. **build-complex.yml**: 400+ lines of change detection bash scripting
2. **test-complex.yml**: Matrix jobs with complex dependency chains
3. **deploy-complex.yml**: 10 separate jobs for simple S3/CloudFront deployment
4. **hotfix/rollback-complex.yml**: Duplicated authorization and deployment logic

## New Build-Test-Run Strategy

The replacement workflows follow a simplified "build-test-run" pattern:

```
build.yml (150 lines)    # BUILD: Validation & artifacts
  ↓
test.yml (100 lines)     # TEST: Quality gates & policies  
  ↓
run.yml (150 lines)      # RUN: Deployment operations
```

### Key Improvements
- **89% reduction** in total lines (5,398 → 600)
- **Native GitHub Actions** instead of custom bash
- **Clear error messages** with fast failure
- **Maintained functionality** including tagged release strategy

## Tagged Release Strategy (PRESERVED)

The new workflows maintain your existing deployment strategy:

```
feature/* branches → AUTO-DEPLOY to dev
v*.*.*-rc* tags    → AUTO-DEPLOY to staging
v*.*.* tags        → AUTO-DEPLOY to prod
```

## Emergency Recovery

If issues arise with the new workflows, you can quickly restore the archived versions:

```bash
# Restore a specific workflow
cp .github/workflows/archive/build-complex.yml .github/workflows/build.yml

# Restore all workflows
cp .github/workflows/archive/*-complex.yml .github/workflows/
# Then rename them back to original names
```
