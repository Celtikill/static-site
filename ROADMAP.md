# Project Roadmap

**Last Updated**: September 22, 2025
**Project Status**: Infrastructure operational, ready for multi-account expansion

## üéØ Overview

This roadmap outlines the development path for the AWS Static Website Infrastructure project, from immediate tactical tasks through strategic long-term enhancements. The project provides enterprise-grade static website hosting with multi-account architecture, comprehensive security, and cost optimization.

## üöÄ Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### Complete Multi-Account Deployment
**Status**: Ready to Execute
**Impact**: Enables full production readiness

#### Bootstrap Remaining Environments
```bash
# Staging Environment
gh workflow run bootstrap-distributed-backend.yml \
  --field project_name=static-site \
  --field environment=staging \
  --field confirm_bootstrap=BOOTSTRAP-DISTRIBUTED

# Production Environment
gh workflow run bootstrap-distributed-backend.yml \
  --field project_name=static-site \
  --field environment=prod \
  --field confirm_bootstrap=BOOTSTRAP-DISTRIBUTED
```

#### Deploy Infrastructure
- Deploy to staging environment (15 minutes)
- Deploy to production environment (15 minutes)
- Validate multi-account deployment (30 minutes)
- Test CloudFront invalidation across environments
- Verify monitoring and alerting functionality
