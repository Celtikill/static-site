# Cost Projection System Documentation

## Overview

The Cost Projection System provides automated AWS cost calculations and budget validation throughout the CI/CD pipeline. It helps teams understand, track, and control infrastructure costs before and after deployment.

## Architecture

### System Components

1. **Cost Projection Module** (`terraform/modules/cost-projection/`)
   - Calculates monthly and annual AWS costs
   - Generates reports in multiple formats
   - Provides budget validation logic

2. **CI/CD Integration**
   - **BUILD Phase**: Cost projection and report generation
   - **TEST Phase**: Budget validation and cost thresholds
   - **RUN Phase**: Post-deployment cost verification

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Comprehensive test suite for cost calculations
   - Budget validation logic testing
   - Integration testing with main infrastructure

## Cost Calculations

### Supported AWS Services

| Service | Cost Components | Calculation Method |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **S3** | Storage, requests, cross-region replication | Based on storage volume and usage patterns |
| **CloudFront** | Data transfer, HTTPS requests | Environment-specific traffic multipliers |
| **WAF** | Web ACL, rules, request processing | Rule count and request volume |
| **Route53** | Hosted zones, DNS queries | Zone count and query volume |
| **KMS** | Keys, API requests | Key count and operation volume |
| **CloudWatch** | Logs, metrics, dashboards, alarms | Log volume and metric count |
| **SNS** | Topics, notifications | Notification volume |

### Environment-Specific Multipliers

```
Development: 0.7x (reduced usage)
Staging:     0.8x (moderate usage)  
Production:  1.0x (full usage)
```

### Current Cost Projections

| Environment | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Budget Limit |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Development | $25.50 | $306.00 | $50.00 |
| Staging | $36.75 | $441.00 | $75.00 |
| Production | $93.25 | $1,119.00 | $200.00 |

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

### BUILD Workflow - Cost Projection Job

```yaml
cost-projection:
  name: "üìä Cost Projection"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 8
  needs: [info, infrastructure]
  if: needs.info.outputs.has_terraform_changes == 'true' || github.event.inputs.force_build == 'true'
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Generate terraform plan for cost analysis
- Calculate environment-specific costs
- Create cost reports (Markdown, JSON)
- Set budget thresholds
- Upload cost artifacts

**Outputs:**
- `monthly_cost`: Projected monthly cost
- `budget_status`: healthy/warning/critical
- `cost_report_available`: Report generation status

### TEST Workflow - Cost Validation Job

```yaml
cost-validation:
  name: "üí∞ Cost Validation"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 8
  needs: [info]
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Download cost projections from BUILD phase
- Validate costs against budget thresholds
- Apply environment-specific enforcement rules
- Generate optimization recommendations
- Block deployments if costs exceed limits

**Budget Thresholds:**
- **Warning**: 80% of budget limit
- **Critical**: 100% of budget limit

**Enforcement Rules:**
- **Production**: BLOCKS deployment if costs exceed budget
- **Staging**: WARNS but allows deployment
- **Development**: LOGS warnings for awareness

### RUN Workflow - Cost Verification Job

```yaml
cost-verification:
  name: "üí∞ Post-Deployment Cost Verification"
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 8
  needs: [info, infrastructure, website]
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Verify cost tracking is enabled
- Check resource tagging for cost allocation
- Compare projected vs actual deployment
- Set up cost monitoring recommendations
- Generate post-deployment reports

## Budget Management

### Budget Limits by Environment

```yaml
Development:
  monthly_limit: $50
  warning_threshold: 80%  # $40
  critical_threshold: 100% # $50

Staging:
  monthly_limit: $75
  warning_threshold: 80%  # $60
  critical_threshold: 100% # $75

Production:
  monthly_limit: $200
  warning_threshold: 80%  # $160
  critical_threshold: 100% # $200
```

### Deployment Enforcement

| Environment | Budget Status | Action |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Production** | Critical (‚â•100%) | üî¥ **BLOCKS** deployment |
| **Production** | Warning (‚â•80%) | üü° **WARNS** but allows deployment |
| **Staging** | Critical (‚â•100%) | üü° **WARNS** but allows deployment |
| **Staging** | Warning (‚â•80%) | üü¢ **ALLOWS** deployment |
| **Development** | Any | üü¢ **ALLOWS** deployment |

## Cost Reports

### Report Formats

1. **JSON** (`cost-projection.json`)
   ```json
   {
     "environment": "dev",
     "costs": {
       "monthly_usd": 25.50,
       "annual_usd": 306.00
     },
     "budget": {
       "limit_usd": 50,
       "utilization_percent": 51,
       "status": "healthy"
     }
   }
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Manual Cost Calculation

```bash
# Run cost projection for development
cd terraform
tofu plan -var="environment=dev" -var="monthly_budget_limit=50"

# View cost outputs
tofu output monthly_cost_projection
tofu output cost_report_markdown
```

### Testing Cost Calculations

```bash
# Run cost projection unit tests
cd test/unit
./test-cost-projection.sh

# Run specific cost tests  
./run-tests.sh cost-projection

# Run all tests including cost validation
./run-tests.sh all
```

### Manual Workflow Execution

```bash
# Force cost projection in BUILD workflow
gh workflow run build.yml --field force_build=true --field environment=dev

# Test cost validation independently
gh workflow run test.yml --field skip_build_check=true --field force_all_jobs=true

# Run deployment with cost verification
gh workflow run run.yml --field environment=dev --field deploy_infrastructure=true
```

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Development Environment
- Consider scheduled shutdown during non-business hours
- Use smaller CloudFront cache behaviors for testing
- Monitor daily spend to catch cost spikes early
- Review actual vs projected costs weekly

### Staging Environment
- Monitor actual usage vs. projections before production
- Consider Reserved Instances if usage patterns are predictable
- Compare staging costs with development baseline
- Set up alerts at 80% of staging budget

### Production Environment
- **CRITICAL**: Set up real-time cost monitoring and alerts
- Enable AWS Cost Explorer for detailed analysis
- Configure budget alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% thresholds
- Consider Reserved Instances for 30-60% cost savings
- Schedule weekly cost reviews and optimization analysis

## Multi-Account Cost Projections

### Projected Monthly Costs (Post-Migration)

| Account Type | Services | Monthly Cost |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Management** | Organizations, SSM | $5 |
| **Security** | GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config | $100 |
| **Workload (All 3 Envs)** | Static website infrastructure | $154 |
| **Total Organization** | | **$259** |

### Cost Allocation Strategy

- **Environment Tags**: Filter costs by dev/staging/prod
- **Account Separation**: Clear cost attribution per account
- **Service Tags**: Track costs by AWS service type
- **Project Tags**: Allocate costs to specific projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cost Projection Not Available**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è No cost projection data available from BUILD phase
   ```
   - Ensure BUILD workflow completed successfully
   - Check that terraform changes were detected
   - Verify cost projection module integration

2. **Budget Validation Failures**
   ```
   ‚ùå PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED - Cost exceeds budget
   ```
   - Review cost projections and optimize resources
   - Increase budget limit if justified
   - Check for unexpected cost drivers

3. **Unit Test Failures**
   ```
   ‚ùå Cost calculation logic incorrect
   ```
   - Verify pricing data is up to date
   - Check environment multiplier logic
   - Review service cost calculations

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check cost projection module
tofu validate terraform/modules/cost-projection/

# Test cost calculations manually
cd test/unit && ./test-cost-projection.sh

# View detailed cost breakdown
tofu output -json cost_report_json | jq '.'

# Check workflow artifacts
gh run list --workflow=build.yml
gh run view <run-id> --log
```
