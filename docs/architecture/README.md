## System Architecture

Enterprise-grade serverless static website infrastructure implementing AWS Well-Architected Framework principles with zero-trust security and automated CI/CD.

### Core Components

**Infrastructure Layer**:
- **S3**: Primary storage with encryption, versioning, intelligent tiering
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN with edge locations, custom headers, compression
- **WAF**: OWASP Top 10 protection, rate limiting, geographic restrictions
- **Route53**: DNS management with health checks and failover

**Security Layer**:
- **Origin Access Control**: Prevents direct S3 access
- **KMS Encryption**: At-rest data protection
- **OIDC Authentication**: GitHub Actions without stored credentials
- **IAM Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

**Monitoring Layer**:
- **CloudWatch**: Metrics, logs, and alerting
- **Cost Management**: Budget alerts and optimization
- **Performance Tracking**: Core web vitals and availability

### CI/CD Pipeline

**BUILD ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí RUN Strategy**:

1. **BUILD** (5-10 min): Infrastructure validation, enhanced security scanning, artifact creation
2. **TEST** (10-15 min): Policy validation, unit testing, environment health checks  
3. **RUN** (15-25 min): Environment-specific deployment with approval gates

**Security Integration**:
- **Static Analysis**: Checkov (IaC) + Trivy (vulnerabilities) with detailed findings
- **Policy Validation**: OPA/Rego with environment-aware enforcement
- **Compliance**: ASVS L1/L2, OWASP Top 10 protection

**Deployment Strategy**:
- **Development**: Auto-deploy on feature branches
- **Staging**: Manual approval via PR to main
- **Production**: Code owner authorization with tagged releases

## Terraform Modules

**Module Architecture**:
- **S3 Module**: Bucket configuration, encryption, access control, versioning
- **CloudFront Module**: Distribution, origins, behaviors, security headers  
- **WAF Module**: Web ACL, rules, IP sets, rate limiting
- **Monitoring Module**: Dashboards, alarms, log groups, budget alerts

**Module Dependencies**:
```
main.tf ‚Üí S3 Module ‚Üí CloudFront Module ‚Üí WAF Module
                   ‚Üò Monitoring Module
```

**Key Features**:
- **Modular Design**: Reusable, testable components
- **Variable Validation**: Input constraints and type checking
- **Output Chaining**: Module outputs used as inputs
- **Environment Scaling**: dev/staging/prod configurations
