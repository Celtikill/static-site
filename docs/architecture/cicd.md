## Workflow Implementation Details

### 1. BUILD Workflow (`build.yml`)

The BUILD phase (detailed in the diagram above) handles infrastructure preparation, validation, and artifact creation across four parallel tracks: infrastructure validation, security analysis, content preparation, and analysis & documentation.

**Purpose**: Infrastructure preparation, validation, and artifact creation  
**Triggers**: Pull requests, pushes to main, manual dispatch  

**Key Features**:
- **Infrastructure Validation**: OpenTofu formatting, validation, and planning (shown in Infrastructure Validation subgraph)
- **Security Scanning**: Parallel Checkov and Trivy analysis with threshold enforcement (Security Analysis subgraph)
- **Content Preparation**: HTML validation, security checks, and build optimization (Content Preparation subgraph)
- **Change Detection**: Intelligent detection of infrastructure, content, and configuration changes
- **Artifact Management**: All tracks converge to produce build artifacts for downstream workflows

**Architecture Components**:

#### Change Detection Logic
```yaml
# Detects changes to trigger appropriate downstream actions
detect-changes:
  paths-filter:
    infrastructure: ['terraform/**']
    content: ['src/**']  
    workflows: ['.github/workflows/**']
    documentation: ['docs/**']
```

#### Security Scanning Pipeline
```yaml
# Parallel security analysis with threshold validation
security-analysis:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      scanner: [checkov, trivy]
  threshold-validation:
    checkov-threshold: 0.95  # 95% pass rate required
    trivy-critical: 0        # Zero critical vulnerabilities
```

#### Cost Analysis Integration
```yaml
# Automated cost estimation per environment
cost-estimation:
  environments: [dev, staging, prod]
  monthly-analysis: true
  annual-projections: true
```

### 2. TEST Workflow (`test.yml`)

The TEST phase (detailed in the diagram above) executes comprehensive validation through three main tracks: unit testing with 269 assertions, policy validation, and integration testing with cleanup.

**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation including unit tests, policy validation, and integration testing  
**Trigger**: Successful BUILD workflow completion  

**Key Features**:
- **Unit Testing**: Parallel execution of 269 individual test assertions across all 5 infrastructure modules (Unit Testing subgraph)
- **Policy Validation**: OPA/Conftest security and compliance rule enforcement (Policy Validation subgraph)
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end deployment validation with real AWS resources and automated cleanup (Integration Testing subgraph)
- **Matrix Strategy**: Parallel test execution for optimal performance with consolidated reporting

**Architecture Components**:

#### Unit Testing Matrix
```yaml
# Parallel module testing for performance
unit-testing:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      module: [s3, cloudfront, waf, iam, monitoring]
  test-coverage:
    s3: 49 tests
    cloudfront: 55 tests  
    waf: 50 tests
    iam: 58 tests
    monitoring: 57 tests
```

#### Policy Validation Framework
```yaml
# OPA/Conftest governance validation
policy-validation:
  security-policies: DENY on violations
  compliance-policies: WARN on deviations
  policy-sources:

# Semantic version detection and routing
version-detection:
  patterns:
    release-candidate: 'v*.*.*-rc*'    # ‚Üí staging deployment
    stable-release: 'v*.*.*'          # ‚Üí production deployment  
    hotfix-release: 'v*.*.*-hotfix.*' # ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production
```

#### Release Orchestration
```yaml
# Automated release management
release-process:
  build-trigger: automatic
  test-validation: required
  github-release: automated
  deployment-routing: version-based
```

### 4. DEPLOY Workflow (`deploy.yml`)

The DEPLOY phase (detailed in the diagram above) executes deployments through sequential infrastructure and content deployment, followed by environment progression with approval gates.

**Purpose**: Unified deployment workflow for all environments with approval gates  
**Triggers**: RELEASE workflow, manual dispatch  

**Key Features**:
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: Sequential Terraform apply and post-deploy validation (Infrastructure Deployment subgraph)
- **Content Deployment**: S3 sync, CloudFront cache invalidation, and health checks (Content Deployment subgraph)
- **Environment Progression**: Automated dev deployment with manual approval gates for staging and production (Environment Progression subgraph)
- **Health Validation**: Comprehensive post-deployment verification and monitoring with notifications

**Architecture Components**:

#### Environment Resolution
```yaml
# Dynamic environment determination
environment-resolution:
  priority:
    1: manual-input           # github.event.inputs.environment
    2: repository-variable    # vars.DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT
    3: fallback-default      # "dev"
```

#### Approval Gate Configuration
```yaml
# Environment-specific approval requirements
approval-gates:
  development: none
  staging: 1-reviewer-required
  production: 2-reviewers-required + deployment-window
```

#### Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
# Infrastructure and content deployment
deployment-process:
  infrastructure-deployment: opentofu-apply
  post-deployment-validation: health-checks
  content-deployment: s3-sync
  cache-invalidation: cloudfront-invalidation
  verification: end-to-end-testing
```

security-scanners:
  checkov:
    threshold: 0.95      # 95% pass rate required
    severity: all        # Scan all severity levels
  trivy:
    critical: 0          # Zero critical vulnerabilities
    high: 5              # Maximum 5 high-severity issues
  opa-conftest:
    security-policies: deny-on-violation
    compliance-policies: warn-on-deviation
```

### Secrets and Credential Management
