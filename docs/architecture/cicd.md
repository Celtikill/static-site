## Workflow Implementation Details

### 1. BUILD Workflow (`build.yml`)

**Purpose**: Infrastructure preparation, validation, and artifact creation  
**Triggers**: Pull requests, pushes to main, manual dispatch  

**Key Features**:
- **Infrastructure Validation**: OpenTofu formatting, validation, and planning
- **Security Scanning**: Parallel Checkov and Trivy analysis with threshold enforcement
- **Content Preparation**: HTML validation, security checks, and build optimization
- **Change Detection**: Intelligent detection of infrastructure, content, and configuration changes

      scanner: [checkov, trivy]
  threshold-validation:
    checkov-threshold: 0.95  # 95% pass rate required
    trivy-critical: 0        # Zero critical vulnerabilities
```

#### Cost Analysis Integration

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of all user inputs
- **Secret Management**: GitHub Secrets with environment-specific access
- **OIDC Authentication**: Temporary AWS credentials via OIDC federation

**Security Controls**:
```yaml
# Pinned actions for supply chain security
actions:
  - uses: actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744  # v3.6.0
  - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@633666f66e0061ca3b725c73b2ec20cd13a8fdd1  # v2.0.3
  
# Input validation and sanitization
input-validation:
  required-fields: validation
  content-sanitization: enabled

```

### Multi-Scanner Security Analysis

**Security Scanning Pipeline**:
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security scanning
- **Trivy**: Configuration and vulnerability scanning  
- **OPA/Conftest**: Policy-as-code governance validation
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Configurable security thresholds

**Scanning Configuration**:
```yaml
# Multi-scanner security validation
security-scanners:
  checkov:
    threshold: 0.95      # 95% pass rate required
    severity: all        # Scan all severity levels
  trivy:
    critical: 0          # Zero critical vulnerabilities
    high: 5              # Maximum 5 high-severity issues
  opa-conftest:
    security-policies: deny-on-violation
    compliance-policies: warn-on-deviation
```

### Secrets and Credential Management

**OIDC Implementation**:
```yaml
# GitHub OIDC configuration for AWS access
oidc-configuration:
  provider: github-actions
  aws-integration: role-assumption
  temporary-credentials: 1-hour-expiry
  environment-separation: dedicated-roles
```

**Secret Management Strategy**:
- **No Long-Lived Credentials**: OIDC-based temporary credentials only
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate AWS roles per environment
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging via CloudTrail
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions per role

## Quality Assurance Framework

2. **Integration Testing**: Cross-module compatibility validation
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete deployment validation
4. **Policy Testing**: Security and compliance rule validation
5. **Performance Testing**: Build and deployment performance validation

**Quality Gates**:
```yaml
# Quality assurance checkpoints
quality-gates:
  unit-test-threshold: 100%     # All tests must pass
  security-scan-threshold: 95%  # 95% security compliance
  coverage-requirement: 100%    # Full infrastructure coverage
  performance-benchmark: defined-slas
```

### Comprehensive Reporting

**Report Generation**:
