    accTitle: Three-Phase CI/CD Pipeline Overview
    accDescr: High-level overview of the three-phase continuous integration and deployment pipeline with associated security and quality gates. Code pushes trigger the BUILD phase (~20 seconds) which performs security scanning with Checkov and Trivy while creating deployment artifacts. Upon BUILD success, the TEST phase (~35 seconds) executes OPA policy validation for security and compliance checks along with Terraform validation. After TEST passes, the RUN phase (~1m49s) orchestrates infrastructure deployment via OpenTofu and website deployment to S3 and CloudFront. This progressive pipeline architecture implements fail-fast principles with each phase gating the next, ensuring security vulnerabilities and policy violations are detected early before any infrastructure changes occur. The total end-to-end execution time of approximately 2 minutes 44 seconds provides rapid feedback while maintaining comprehensive security validation. This approach reduces remediation costs by catching issues early in the development lifecycle.

## Pipeline Overview

### Three-Phase Architecture

| Phase | Purpose | Duration | Tools | Trigger |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|---------|
| **BUILD** | Security scanning & artifact creation | ~20s | Checkov, Trivy, cost estimation | Push to any branch |
| **TEST** | Policy validation & compliance | ~35s | OPA/Conftest, Terraform validate | After BUILD success |
| **RUN** | Infrastructure & website deployment | ~1m49s | OpenTofu, AWS CLI, S3 sync | After TEST success |

### Security Gates

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'default', 'themeVariables': {'fontSize':'16px'}}}%%
graph TD
    accTitle: CI/CD Security Gates and Decision Flow
    accDescr: Progressive security validation flow with fail-fast decision gates protecting production deployments. Developer code pushes trigger the BUILD phase which performs Checkov and Trivy security scanning. Failed scans immediately block deployment requiring fixes, while passing scans advance to the TEST phase. The TEST phase validates OPA security and compliance policies. Policy violations block deployment and require remediation, while compliant code advances to the RUN phase for actual deployment. The RUN phase deploys infrastructure and website content with automated health validation. Deployment failures trigger automatic rollback to the last known good state preserving service availability, while successful deployments complete with the website going live. This multi-gate approach implements defense-in-depth validation with clear pass/fail decision points, creating comprehensive audit trails for security and compliance. Each gate reduces risk progressively, catching issues earlier in the pipeline where remediation costs are lower and blast radius is contained.

## BUILD Phase: Security & Artifacts

**Duration**: ~20-23 seconds

### What Happens

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'default', 'themeVariables': {'fontSize':'16px'}}}%%
graph LR
    accTitle: BUILD Phase Security Scanning Workflow
    accDescr: Sequential security validation workflow in the BUILD phase ensuring infrastructure-as-code security before deployment. The workflow begins by checking out source code from the repository. Checkov performs infrastructure-as-code security scanning validating Terraform configurations against 50+ built-in security policies covering AWS security best practices, CIS benchmarks, and compliance frameworks. Trivy conducts vulnerability scanning of dependencies, container images, and infrastructure configurations detecting known CVEs and security misconfigurations. Cost estimation analyzes proposed infrastructure changes predicting AWS costs for budget validation and cost optimization. Artifact creation packages validated code and scan results for downstream pipeline phases. Report generation produces comprehensive security summaries with pass/fail status, vulnerability counts, and remediation guidance. The BUILD phase completes in approximately 20 seconds providing rapid security feedback. Failed security scans block the pipeline immediately preventing vulnerable code from advancing to deployment, implementing fail-fast security principles that reduce remediation costs.

    linkStyle 4 stroke:#333333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Security Scanning

#### Checkov (Infrastructure Security)
```yaml
# Scans Terraform for security issues
- Critical/High severity: Block deployment
- Medium/Low severity: Warning only
- Skipped checks: Documented in .checkov.yaml
```

**Example output:**
```
Passed checks: 42
Failed checks: 0
Skipped checks: 3
```

#### Trivy (Vulnerability Detection)
```yaml
# Scans for:
- Container vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure misconfigurations
- Secret detection
- License issues
```

**Severity handling:**
- CRITICAL/HIGH: Fail build
- MEDIUM/LOW: Warn only

### Cost Estimation

```yaml
# Environment-specific cost projections
Development: $1-5/month (S3 only)
Staging: $15-25/month (CloudFront + S3)
Production: $25-50/month (Full stack)
```

### Artifact Creation

**Artifacts produced:**
1. **website-content** - Static website files (src/)
2. **terraform-configs** - Infrastructure as code (terraform/)
3. **security-reports** - Scan results and findings
4. **cost-estimates** - Environment-specific cost projections

**Retention**: 30 days

## TEST Phase: Policy & Validation

**Duration**: ~35-50 seconds

### What Happens

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'default', 'themeVariables': {'fontSize':'16px'}}}%%
graph LR
    accTitle: TEST Phase Policy Validation Workflow
    accDescr: Comprehensive policy validation workflow ensuring security and compliance before infrastructure deployment. The workflow retrieves artifacts from the BUILD phase containing validated code and security scan results. OPA Security Policies evaluate infrastructure configurations using Rego policy language implementing 6 deny rules that block deployment for critical violations including unencrypted S3 buckets, non-HTTPS CloudFront distributions, wildcard IAM permissions, disabled KMS rotation, public access exposure, and missing audit logging. OPA Compliance Policies apply 5 warning rules for best practices including resource tagging, cost optimization, monitoring configuration, backup strategies, and documentation requirements that warn but allow deployment to continue. Terraform Validation performs syntax checking, logic validation, and generates execution plans exported as JSON for policy analysis ensuring infrastructure-as-code correctness. Summary generation produces comprehensive validation reports with policy evaluation results, compliance scores, and remediation recommendations. The TEST phase completes in approximately 35-50 seconds. Environment-specific enforcement varies from informational in development to strict blocking in production, balancing rapid iteration with production safety. Failed security policies block deployment requiring fixes while compliance warnings create audit trails without blocking.

    linkStyle 3 stroke:#333333,stroke-width:2px
```

### OPA Policy Validation

#### Security Policies (Deny Rules)

6 security policies that **block deployment** if violated:

```rego
# Examples:
1. S3 buckets must have encryption enabled
2. CloudFront must use HTTPS only
3. IAM policies must not allow wildcard permissions
4. KMS keys must have rotation enabled
5. Public access must be explicitly blocked
6. Logging must be enabled for audit trail
```

**Result**: ✅ Pass → Continue | ❌ Fail → Block

#### Compliance Policies (Warnings)

5 compliance policies that **warn but don't block**:

```rego
# Examples:
1. Resources should have descriptive tags
2. Cost-optimization features recommended
3. Monitoring dashboards should be configured
4. Backup strategies should be defined
5. Documentation should be up to date
```

**Result**: ⚠️ Warning logged, deployment continues

### Terraform Validation

```yaml
Steps:
1. Initialize with local backend (no state dependencies)
2. Validate syntax and logic
3. Generate plan for policy analysis
4. Export plan as JSON for OPA evaluation
```

### Environment-Specific Enforcement

| Environment | Security Policy | Compliance Policy |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Development** | INFORMATIONAL | INFORMATIONAL |
| **Staging** | WARNING | WARNING |
| **Production** | **STRICT (Block)** | WARNING |

## RUN Phase: Deployment

**Duration**: ~1m30s - 2m

### What Happens

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'default', 'themeVariables': {'fontSize':'16px'}}}%%
graph TD
    accTitle: RUN Phase Deployment Orchestration Workflow
    accDescr: Flexible deployment orchestration supporting infrastructure-only, website-only, or combined deployments with comprehensive validation. The workflow retrieves validated artifacts from the TEST phase and determines deployment scope based on workflow inputs. Infrastructure deployment uses OpenTofu to provision AWS resources via OIDC authentication to the Management Account Central Role, then assumes environment-specific roles in target accounts for deployment. Resources deployed include S3 buckets with KMS encryption, CloudFront distributions with WAF protection when enabled, CloudWatch monitoring dashboards and alarms, SNS notification topics, and KMS encryption keys. Website deployment syncs static content to S3 with intelligent delta uploads transferring only changed files, gzip compression for text resources, proper cache-control headers for optimal CDN performance, and CloudFront cache invalidation when distributions are enabled. Combined deployments execute infrastructure provisioning first ensuring resources exist before website content deployment. Resource verification validates successful infrastructure provisioning checking resource states and outputs. Health checks validate website accessibility with HTTP 200 responses, security headers presence, CloudFront serving, active WAF rules, and monitoring dashboard availability. Monitoring setup configures observability with metrics collection and alerting. The RUN phase completes in approximately 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Deployment failures trigger automatic rollback to the last known good state preserving service availability and implementing safe deployment practices.

```

**Resources deployed:**
- S3 buckets (website content, logs)
- CloudFront distribution (if enabled)
- WAF rules (if CloudFront enabled)
- CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
- SNS topics for notifications
- KMS keys for encryption

### Website Deployment

```yaml
Steps:
1. Sync website files to S3
   - Only changed files uploaded
   - Gzip compression for text files
   - Cache-Control headers set
2. Invalidate CloudFront cache (if enabled)
3. Verify website accessibility
4. Update monitoring dashboards
```

### Health Validation

**Automated checks:**
- ✅ HTTP 200 OK response
- ✅ Security headers present
- ✅ CloudFront serving content (if enabled)
- ✅ WAF rules active (if enabled)
- ✅ Monitoring dashboards available

## Workflow Routing Logic

### Automatic Triggers

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'default', 'themeVariables': {'fontSize':'16px'}}}%%
graph TD
    accTitle: Workflow Routing and Trigger Logic
    accDescr: Branch-based workflow routing implementing progressive deployment strategy with environment-aware automation. Code pushes trigger branch-conditional routing where commits to the main branch execute the full BUILD-TEST-RUN pipeline deploying automatically to the development environment, while commits to feature branches execute only BUILD and TEST phases for validation without deployment allowing safe experimentation. Pull requests trigger BUILD and TEST phases for validation-only workflows ensuring proposed changes meet security and policy requirements before merge, providing quality gates in the code review process. Scheduled workflows execute nightly security scans performing regular vulnerability assessments and compliance checks independent of code changes. The main branch automatic deployment to development supports rapid iteration and testing in a safe sandbox environment. Feature branch validation without deployment prevents untested code from reaching any environment while still providing security feedback. This routing strategy implements branch-based deployment patterns following GitFlow principles with progressive promotion from development through staging to production. The architecture balances automation for efficiency with safety gates preventing unauthorized deployments, while maintaining comprehensive audit trails of all deployment decisions and workflow executions.

BUILD: Can force rebuild with specific parameters
TEST: Can test specific environment configs
RUN: Can deploy to any environment with full control
Bootstrap: Always manual (safety gate)
```

### Environment Routing

| Trigger | Environment | Approval Required |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Push to `main` | dev | ❌ No |
| Manual dispatch → staging | staging | ⚠️ Recommended |
| Manual dispatch → prod | production | ✅ **Required** |

- name: Custom Lint
  run: |
    # Your custom linting logic
    yamllint -d relaxed .github/workflows/
```

### Modifying Security Policies

**Location**: `policies/*.rego`

```rego
# Example: Add custom OPA policy
package terraform.custom

deny[msg] {
  resource := input.resource_changes[_]
  resource.type == "aws_s3_bucket"
  not resource.change.after.versioning[_].enabled

  msg := sprintf("S3 bucket %s must have versioning enabled", [resource.name])
}
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

**Location**: `terraform/environments/{env}/`

```hcl
# Customize features per environment
variable "enable_cloudfront" {
  default = false  # true for staging/prod
}

variable "enable_waf" {
  default = false  # true for prod
}
```

---

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Create feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make changes** to code or infrastructure
3. **Push to GitHub** - Triggers BUILD → TEST
4. **Review results** - Fix any failures
5. **Create PR** - Requires passing checks
6. **Merge to main** - Triggers deployment to dev
7. **Test in dev** - Verify changes
8. **Promote to staging** - Manual workflow trigger
9. **Validate in staging** - Final checks
10. **Deploy to production** - Manual with approval

### Security Best Practices

- ✅ Never skip security scans
- ✅ Review all policy violations
- ✅ Use least privilege IAM roles
- ✅ Enable all logging and monitoring
- ✅ Test in dev before staging/prod
- ✅ Require approval for production
- ✅ Document any exception/skip

### Performance Optimization

- ✅ Use artifact caching
- ✅ Parallelize independent jobs
- ✅ Deploy infrastructure and website separately when possible
- ✅ Use CloudFront invalidation patterns (not /*)
- ✅ Compress artifacts before upload
- ✅ Clean up old artifacts regularly
