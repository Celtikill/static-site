# Workflows Guide

> **üéØ Purpose**: Comprehensive guide to CI/CD workflows and pipeline operations  
> **üë• Audience**: DevOps engineers, platform teams, developers  
> **‚è±Ô∏è Reading Time**: 15 minutes

## Workflow Overview

The project uses a simplified **BUILD ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí RUN** pipeline strategy with enhanced security reporting and focused job separation.

### Core Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Duration | Triggers |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| **BUILD** | Infrastructure validation, security scanning, artifact creation | ~5-10 min | Push, PRs, Manual |
| **TEST** | Policy validation, unit testing, environment health checks | ~10-15 min | BUILD success |
| **RUN** | Infrastructure and website deployment to environments | ~15-25 min | TEST success, Manual |

### Specialized Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Access Level |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **RELEASE** | Version management and automated deployment | Maintainers |
| **EMERGENCY** | Hotfix and rollback capabilities | Code owners only |

## BUILD Workflow

**Enhanced Security Reporting**:
- **Granular Steps**: Separate Checkov and Trivy scanning with detailed findings
- **Severity Breakdowns**: Critical, High, Medium, Low counts with sample findings
- **JSON Output**: Full security results preserved as artifacts
- **Blocking Logic**: Critical/High findings fail builds

**Key Steps**:
1. Setup Infrastructure Tools
2. Validate Terraform
3. Setup Security Tools
4. Security Scanning - Checkov
5. Security Scanning - Trivy
6. Process Security Results
7. Validate Website Content
8. Create Artifacts

**Artifacts Created**:
- `website-*.tar.gz`
- `terraform-*.tar.gz`
- `checkov-security-summary.md`
- `trivy-security-summary.md`
- `checkov-results.json`
- `trivy-results.json`

## TEST Workflow

**Focused Job Structure**:
- **test-info** (5 min): Metadata and setup
- **validation-tests** (15 min): All validation logic
- **test-summary** (5 min): Results consolidation

**Enhanced Policy Validation**:
- **Environment-Aware**: Production blocks on violations, staging warns, dev informs
- **OPA/Rego Policies**: S3 encryption, CloudFront HTTPS enforcement
- **Infrastructure Unit Tests**: Terraform plan validation

## RUN Workflow

**Environment-Specific Deployment**:
- **Development**: Auto-deploy on feature branches
- **Staging**: Manual approval via PR to main
- **Production**: Code owner authorization required

**Deployment Process**:
1. Environment validation
2. Infrastructure deployment (Terraform apply)
3. Website deployment (S3 sync)
4. Post-deployment validation

## Usage Commands

### Manual Workflows

```bash
# Force build with security scanning
gh workflow run build.yml -f force_build=true

# Run tests independently
gh workflow run test.yml

# Deploy to specific environment
gh workflow run run.yml -f environment=staging

# Emergency hotfix
gh workflow run emergency.yml -f target_environment=prod -f hotfix_reason="Critical fix"
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check latest workflow runs
gh run list --limit=5

# View specific workflow logs
gh run view --log

# Monitor pipeline health
gh workflow run pipeline-monitor.yml
```

## Development Workflow

**Standard Development**:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/name`
2. Push changes ‚Üí BUILD runs automatically
3. BUILD success ‚Üí TEST runs automatically  
4. TEST success ‚Üí RUN deploys to development
5. Create PR to main ‚Üí Staging deployment after approval

**Tagged Releases**:
- `v*.*.*-rc*` ‚Üí Staging deployment
- `v*.*.*` ‚Üí Production deployment (with approval)

## Security Integration

**BUILD Phase Security**:
- **Checkov**: IaC security scanning with detailed findings
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanning for HIGH/CRITICAL issues
- **Blocking**: Critical/High security issues fail builds

**TEST Phase Security**:  
- **Policy Validation**: Environment-specific enforcement
- **Production**: Zero tolerance for policy violations
- **Staging**: Warnings allowed with clear notifications

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| BUILD fails | Check security findings in step summaries |
| TEST skipped | Ensure BUILD succeeded |
| RUN fails | Verify permissions and environment health |
| Permission denied | Check AWS OIDC configuration |

## Performance Targets

- **BUILD Phase**: < 10 minutes
- **TEST Phase**: < 15 minutes  
- **RUN Phase**: < 25 minutes
- **Overall Pipeline**: < 50 minutes
- **Success Rate**: > 95%
